# Snort Docker Image

## Description of the Project

This repository is part of the SAND5G project, which aims to enhance security in 5G networks. FileAgent is a tool designed to facilitate the management of Snort rules in a containerized environment.

5G -and beyond- networks provide a strong foundation for EU’s digital transformation and are becoming one of the Union’s key assets to compete in the global market.

Securing 5G networks and the services running on top of them requires high quality technical security solutions and also strong collaboration at the operational level.
